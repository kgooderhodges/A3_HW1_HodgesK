# Sass Rebuild - Now with Ajax Request!

## Take the css that can be grouped together and use Sass to nest and import them.

## Broke down the code by referring to the HTML, using the notes there as the names for the sass modules.
### Kept things similar to the HTML so that it would be simple if changes were needed in the future.

# Ajax Request

## Using Ajax and fetch a request is grabbing the course name, code, Professor name, and the dates of class.
# This allows the data to be in a seperate json file and pulled into the html using fetch to bring me the correct information in the corresponding container.
